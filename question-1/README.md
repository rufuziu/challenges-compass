# Question-1  SCOREBOARD  

Reading the "Challenge 1- Week 1 -- Question 1." document,  
I understood this software requirements to code:  

- The first entrie is the number of students in the competition  
must be between 1 and 100 
- The second entrie is the name and the number of problems solved  
(name letters[a-z] and length <= 20)  
(problems solved between 0 and 10)
- The program ends with end-of-file
- Print the student who solved less problems in the format  
"Instancia k", were k is the student instance, your name and  
the number of problems solved 
- If two students solved the same number of problems,  
the worst student will be decide by alphabetical order
