I'm starting this question today(2023-08-17)

Procedure

CREATE TABLE Address, Person;

INSERT INTO Address
                    3 addresses
            Person
                    me with my Address;

SELECT Person(name,email,age), Address(street,complement,state,country)
FROM Person
INNER JOIN Address ON Person(address_id) = Address(addressId)

I have done two queries
To CREATE and DROP
